# WaveletBasedFSA
Automated continuous condition monitoring of industrial electrical machines to identify internal faults has become one of
the critical research areas for the past decade. Among various defects, early-stage identification of insulation failure in
stator winding is of notable demand as it often occurs and accounts for 37% of the overall motor failures. Identifying the
current signature at its embryonic stage will effectively improve industrial machineryâ€™s downtime and repair costs. Recent
advances in computational performance and sensor technology concede advanced systems for achieving these goals. The
design of an AI-based fault signature analyzer (FSA) has been developed in this paper. FSA uses real-time stator current
data in the time and frequency domain from healthy and faulty induction motors to train the various AI-based machine
learning classifiers to identify health conditions using wavelets. Comparing machine learning algorithms such as artificial
neural network, random forest, fuzzy logic, neuro-fuzzy logic, K-nearest neighbors is performed, and various performance
attributes are quantified. A reliable, automatic fault signature from a motor current is thus analyzed using the fusion of a
wavelet-based feature extraction technique and a capable knowledge-based efficient artificial intelligence (AI) approach.
